#Optional Extra

Because the map is generated procedurally, it is possible to edit Map.txt to create your own map!
Simply open the file in your favourite text editor and adjust the 13x13 grid to your liking - 
the number-block correspondance can be found within the file. You must stick to a 13x13 grid, though.
